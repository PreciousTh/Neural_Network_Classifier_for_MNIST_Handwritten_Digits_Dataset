# Neural_Network_Classifier_for_MNIST_Handwritten_Digits_Dataset
Designing and implement a neural network classifier to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

I have initiated this Project to familiarize myself with the fundamental concepts of neural networks and practical aspects of model training, tuning, and evaluation.   

**Breakdown: **

1.  Data preprocessing 
2.  Model design    
3.  Model training and validation    
4.  Model evaluation and testing
